hey greg and nathan let's hack!

main purpose: to serve the opposite function as the pomodoro technique

notes:
- things we will need:
    - index.html
    - styles.css
    - script.js
    - manifest.json

helpful links:
    - https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/building-chrome-extension/
    - https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/browserAction/
    - https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest/

plan of action:
    - create a simple timer extension
    - then, ensue chaos.

technical challenges:
    - difficulty figuring out how to run background functions
    - not being able to call other windows outside of the extension 
    - no free trivia api's, so we had to manually scrape our own (we WANTED to use AJAX FETCH, WE PROMISE!)
